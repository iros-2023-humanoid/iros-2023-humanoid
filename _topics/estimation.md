title: "Floating-base state estimation"

excerpt: "
With the advent of more and more dynamic motions with increasing autonomy, humanoid state estimation is becoming more and more a key factor, and sometimes a limiting one. For instance, the HRP-4 stair climbing example by Caron et al. [1] is not possible without a proper estimator. Thus we need to explicit the recent development for higher estimation precision and new desired features.
