title: "High dynamic balancing"

excerpt: "
Despite the standing stability criterion for robots with co-planar contacts has been established for decades, i.e., restricting the ZMP within the support polygon, it is not clear how to define the standing stability margin when the robot executes high dynamic or impact motion.

Despite the standing stability criterion for robots with co-planar contacts has been established for decades, i.e., restricting the ZMP within the support polygon, it is not clear how to define the standing stability margin when the robot executes high dynamic or impact motion.

Momentum-based control design has demonstrated convincing results for humanoid balancing, such as stabilizing with partial footholds by Wiedebach et al. [1]. Despite the achievements, the momentum-based control design is an active research field with open questions such as:

  * What is the best control design to decouple the angular and linear momentum?
  * For robots performing in-air motions, how to represent the momentum with respect to the earth, to its COM, and to its floating-base?
