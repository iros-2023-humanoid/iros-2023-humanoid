Data-driven approaches have become increasingly relevant in robotic control as they have achieved unprecedented success in various applications, such as sliding contact control [1], agile and dynamic motion skills [2], and locomotion in the wild [3].

By leveraging large datasets of real-world robot motion or simulated data [1], data-driven approaches can learn complex control policies that effectively handle the nonlinear dynamics of the robot. Data-driven approaches can also be adaptable, enabling faster development and deployment of control policies for different tasks and environments. Therefore, data-driven approaches have the potential to improve the performance, robustness, and scalability of whole-body control for humanoid robots.
