Accurate dynamics model is essential for predicting future behavior and optimizing control actions over a finite time horizon. The analytical computation of the robot dynamics becomes availabe recently [1], [2], [3]. By accurately modeling the robot dynamics and accounting for higher-order effects, we expect the controller can better handle disturbances and uncertainties in the system. This can lead to more stable and reliable control performance, even in challenging operating conditions.
