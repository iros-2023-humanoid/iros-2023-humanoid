Humanoid robots have the potential to make a significant impact in various areas, including healthcare, education, and entertainment. Low-cost and open-source humanoid robots have made them more accessible and affordable for these applications, enabling researchers, educators, and enthusiasts to experiment with them without the need for a large budget or extensive technical expertise.

However, deploying whole-body control on open-source humanoid robots [1]  poses several challenges due to limited sensing capabilities and computational resources, inaccurate dynamics models, and simplified mechanical designs. Despite these challenges, researchers at the University of Bonn have successfully achieved championship results with the open-source humanoid robot NimbRo-OP2X in the RoboCup and X-Prize teleoperation challenge. In their presentation, they will share their experience and insights on overcoming these challenges to enable effective whole-body control on low-cost/open-source humanoid robots.
