Dear colleagues and friends,

We are thrilled to announce that our workshop proposal has been accepted by IROS-2023! Out of 99 submissions, our proposal was selected as one of the 48 to be included in the conference. The organizing committee will notify us of the exact date soon, which will either be on October 1st or 5th, 2023, depending on the topic balance.

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to the proposal and supported us throughout the process. We are excited to share our research and insights with you and engage in meaningful discussions with fellow researchers in the field.

Please stay tuned for more information, and we look forward to your participation!
