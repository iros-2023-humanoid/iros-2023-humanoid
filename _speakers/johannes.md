[Johannes Englsberger](https://rmc.dlr.de/rm/en/staff/johannes.englsberger/) received his Dipl.-Ing. degree (equivalent to Masters) in mechanical engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2009. In 2010, he joined the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, as a research scientist. In 2016, he received the Dr.-Ing. degree (equivalent to PhD) again from TUM. His PhD thesis "Combining reduced dynamics models and whole-body control for agile humanoid locomotion" received the Georges Giralt PhD Award 2017 for the best European thesis in robotics. In 2019, he was appointed team leader of DLR's legged locomotion group. In addition to his scientific career at DLR, he joined team IHMC (Florida Institute of Human and Machine Cognition, USA) as a visiting researcher and successfully participated in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC).
