Walking within limits: Implications of Hardware in Humanoid Locomotion with Centroidal Control
</center>



##### Abstract


The most defining feature of a robot is its hardware design, having to compromise between factors such as size, cost, functionality and complexity amongst others. This has direct impact on the capabilities of a system. Besides advancing performance boundaries it is important to acknowledge such limitations and work within them, which can lead to unique and effective solutions. The developed estimation and control techniques for our low-cost, open-source platforms: igus-OP and NimbRo-OP2(X) will serve as a case study. By first examining the hardware limitations, we will navigate through the developed estimation and control techniques present in our robots. Starting with self-stable gaits using a Central Pattern Generator (CPG), including their stabilising feedback mechanisms and ending on the recent method for Direct Centroidal Control with a reduced order five-mass model.
