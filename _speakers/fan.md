I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at ETH Zürich working with Prof. Stelian Coros and Prof. Marco Hutter.

I obtained the PhD degree at JSK Lab, the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. Masayuki Inaba and Prof. Kei Okada from 2016 to 2021. In 2020, I was visiting RSL Lab, ETH Zurich supervised by Prof. Macro Hutter.

I did my Bachelor in Peking University advised by Prof. Huijing Zhao. I was visiting in Microsoft Research Asia (by Prof. Katsushi Ikeuchi) and Takanishi Lab (by Prof. Atsuo Takanishi) during my undergraduate.

In spare time, I was fortunate to work with Erico Guizzo and Evan Ackerman as a Contributor on IEEE Spectrum Robotics, and my great friend Yifan Hou on 机器人学家. My lifelong target is to build the good stuff, and help the good happen.

Reference-free Learning Bipedal Motor Skills via Assistive Force Curricula
</center>



##### Abstract

Reinforcement learning recently shows great progress on legged robots, while bipedal robots in high dimensions but narrow solution space are still challenging to learn. The typical methods introduce the reference joints motion to guide the learning process; however, obtaining a high-quality reference trajectory is nontrivial, and imitation suffers from the local minimum. For general reference-free scenarios, the bipedal robot is discouraged by the early termination and biased sample collection. Inspired by the assistive learning commonly shown in biped animals, we introduce the assistive force to aid the learning process without the requirement of reference trajectories. The learned assistant could be a curricula to lead motor skills learning and is eliminated in the end to shape the learned motion to be plausible. We analyze the assistive system and verify its effectiveness in multiple challenging bipedal skills (Videos and supplementary materials: [https://fanshi14.github.io/me/isrr22](https://fanshi14.github.io/me/isrr22).).
