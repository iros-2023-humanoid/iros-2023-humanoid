[Serena Ivaldi](https://members.loria.fr/SIvaldi/) is a tenured research scientist (chargé de recherche – CR) in INRIA Nancy Grand-Est and LORIA since 2014, working in the project-team LARSEN, directed by Francois Charpillet. Her research is currently focused on robots collaborating with humans. 
She is interested in combining machine learning with control to improve the prediction, adaptation, and interaction skills of robots.

Anticipatory control: using prediction of intended movement for control
</center>



##### Abstract

 In this talk I will present machine learning algorithms to predict the whole-body movement and intention of movement of humans, and I will discuss how we used this prediction in whole-body control of humanoid robots and exoskeletons.
