Alphonsus Adu-Bredu is a PhD Candidate in the Robotics Department at University of Michigan. His research focuses on the integration of high-level task planning and low-level motion control of bipedal humanoid robots. His work won the Best Paper Award in Mobile Manipulation at IROS 2021. He is also a recipient of the prestigious Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship award.

##### Abstract

 For bipedal humanoid robots to successfully operate in the real world, they must be competent at simultaneously executing multiple motion tasks while reacting to unforeseen external disturbances in real-time. The first half of this talk will introduce the  Kinodynamic Fabrics framework as a general whole-body control framework for fast, reactive whole-body control of underactuated humanoid robots. In the second half of this talk, we will go through a live-coding tutorial on how to describe prioritized motion tasks in the Kinodynamic Fabrics framework and how to generate motions and execute them on a simulated Digit robot.
