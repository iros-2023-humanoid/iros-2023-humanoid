[Maurice Fallon](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/maurice-fallon/) (IEEE, Senior Member) is an Associate Professor in Engineering Science and a Royal Society University Research Fellow. He is also a Research Fellow of Wolfson College. He leads the [Dynamic Robot Systems Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/drs/). You will find more information about his research on the DRS website.

He is the principal investigator on 3 large collaborative projects [ORCA](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/orca-research-hub/), [MEMMO](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/memmo-memory-of-motion/), [THING](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/thing-eu-project/) and co-I on [RAIN](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/rain-research-hub/).

His research is focused on probabilistic methods for localization and mapping. He has also made research contributions to state estimation for legged robots and is interested in dynamic motion planning and control. Of particular concern is developing methods which are robust in the most challenging situations by leveraging sensor fusion.
