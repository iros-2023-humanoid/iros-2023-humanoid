[Maurice Fallon](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/maurice-fallon/) (IEEE, Senior Member) is an Associate Professor in Engineering Science and a Royal Society University Research Fellow. He is also a Research Fellow of Wolfson College. He leads the [Dynamic Robot Systems Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/drs/). You will find more information about his research on the DRS website.

He is the principal investigator on 3 large collaborative projects [ORCA](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/orca-research-hub/), [MEMMO](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/memmo-memory-of-motion/), [THING](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/thing-eu-project/) and co-I on [RAIN](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/rain-research-hub/).

His research is focused on probabilistic methods for localization and mapping. He has also made research contributions to state estimation for legged robots and is interested in dynamic motion planning and control. Of particular concern is developing methods which are robust in the most challenging situations by leveraging sensor fusion.

##### Abstract


A novel control scheme for biped robots to manipulate the ZMP three-dimensionally apart from the actual ground profile is presented. It is shown that the linear inverted-pendulum-like dynamics with this scheme can represent a wider class of movements including variation of the body height. Moreover, this can also represent the motion in aerial phase. Based on this, the foot-guided controller proposed by the authors is enhanced to enable the robots to locomote on highly uneven terrains and also to seamlessly transition between walking and running without pre-planning the overall motion reference. The controller guarantees the capturability at landing and defines the motion by a time-variant state feedback, which is analytically derived from a model predictive optimization. It is verified through some computer simulations.
