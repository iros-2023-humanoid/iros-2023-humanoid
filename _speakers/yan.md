##### Biography: 

Dr. Yan Gu received her B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Zhejiang University (China) in 2011 and her Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 2017. She was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) as an Assistant Professor between 2017 and 2022. She has been with the faculty of the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University since Fall 2022. Her research focuses on nonlinear control and hybrid systems with applications to legged locomotion, including bipedal and quadrupedal robot locomotion and exoskeleton-assisted human walking. Her long-term research goal is to realize provably safe and autonomous legged locomotion in dynamic, unstructured environments. Towards reaching this goal, her research draws upon nonlinear control theory, theory of hybrid systems, dynamics, and optimization to create new methods of modeling, state estimation, and control of legged locomotion that explicitly address the complex physical interaction between the robot and the environment. She received the NSF CAREER Award in 2021 and the Verizon’s 5G Robotics Challenge Award in 2019. Her research on legged locomotion has been funded by NSF, ONR, ARL, and Verizon’s 5G Lab and reported by various media such as Boston Globe, CNET, Robotics Business Review, and NPR’s WBUR.

##### Abstract

Legged robots have the potential to assist humans with a wide range of real-world tasks in dynamic, unstructured environments, such as search and rescue on disaster sites, monitoring of natural resources, space exploration, home assistance, and delivery and courier. While legged locomotion on stationary (regular or irregular) surfaces has been extensively studied, legged locomotion on dynamic surfaces, which include surfaces that globally move in the inertial frame (e.g., ships, aircraft, and trains), remains a new robot functionality that has not been tackled. This new functionality will empower legged robots to perform critical, high-risk tasks such as shipboard firefighting and fire suppression as well as disinfection on moving public transportation vehicles to help contain the spread of infectious diseases. Yet, enabling reliable locomotion on dynamic surfaces presents substantial fundamental challenges in legged robot control due to the high complexity of the hybrid, time-varying physical interaction between the robot and the surface. In this talk, Dr. Gu will present the current progress from her research group in creating  new methods of modeling, state estimation, and control of legged robots that achieve provably stable locomotion on dynamic surfaces by explicitly addressing the associated hybrid, time-varying robot dynamics.
