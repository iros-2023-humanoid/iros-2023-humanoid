 [Carlos Mastalli](https://cmastalli.github.io/) is a robotics researcher working in the intersection of model predictive control and machine learning for motor control in legged robots. The aim of his research is to enable robots to move everywhere. In particular, he is focused on the problem of loco-manipulation tasks since it combines the main challenges in robot mobility. His research combines the formalism of model-base approach with the exploration of vast robotâ€™s data.
